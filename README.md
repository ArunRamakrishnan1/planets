Planets & GitHub Introduction
=============================
A cosmic description of our solar systems' celestial bodies,
to introduce the basics of the [GitHub
workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and the [fork-and-PR
contribution model](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### Activity Instructions

1. If you don't have one already, make a GitHub account
[here](https://github.com/join?source=experiment-header-dropdowns-home) and
make sure you have Git on your computer (available by default on the command line
for Linux/OSX or via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for OSX/Windows).
2. [Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)
to your account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right-hand corner of
this page. We'll call your fork `origin`, since you're starting your own contribution
from here.
3. [Clone your fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone) of this
repository to your personal computer (what we will hereafter call `local`) 
4. Make some changes to a file in this repository by editing it in your favorite
text editor (like VI or Notepad++), then commit your changes on `local`.  If you
have a [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) account, you can check out
[this interactive tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) for help.
5. Push your changes from `local` to `origin`.  This can be done with GitHub
Desktop or on the command line by executing
    ```
    $ git push origin master
    ```
inside the directory for the `planets` repository on `local`
6. [Open a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)
to the [GT-IDEaS/planets repository](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/planets), what
we'll call `upstream` (since your `origin` is a fork of this repository, this
repository is one "level" above your `origin`).
7. Success! 

Your pull request can be approved, returned marked for you to change, or
closed.  Whichever occurs, the changes you've proposed in your pull request
will generally be discussed among the development community and repository
owners and/or maintainers before a final decision is made. Congratulations on
your first contribution to a collaborative project on GitHub!
