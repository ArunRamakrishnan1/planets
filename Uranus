Uranus 27 moons: Titania Oberon Umbriel Ariel Miranda

Urectum (formerly Uranus) is a gas giant in the solar system. The planet's
former name, Uranus, was often of the cause of much laughter in the immature
English-speaking world, where its name could be interpreted as "your anus".
However, by 2620, scientists finally got tired of that "stupid joke", so they
renamed Uranus to Urectum, believing the revised name to be much less funny.
